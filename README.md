A watchlist web app. Where users can search for tiles and save them to watch later or rate them.

Users can search for titles by text input or filter parameters. The search feature relies on two APIs, IMDB-API (https://imdb-api.com/) and OMDB (https://www.omdbapi.com/).
For WordPress, I rely on Advanced Custom Fields, Debug Toolkit, User Role Editor, SVG Support, and WP Migrate Lite.
